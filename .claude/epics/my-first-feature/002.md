# Task: Data Discovery and Schema Analysis Tools

## Description
Develop automated tools to discover and analyze all PostgreSQL instances, identify data types, analyze schemas, detect conflicts, and classify data as application data, broker data, or unknown/unused data.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] PostgreSQL instance discovery tool scans all accessible databases
- [ ] Schema analysis tool identifies tables, relationships, and data types
- [ ] Data profiling tool analyzes data patterns, quality, and volume
- [ ] Classification engine categorizes data using ML-based approach
- [ ] Conflict detection identifies schema conflicts and data duplicates
- [ ] Data lineage tracking captures source-to-target mappings

## Technical Details
- **Discovery Tool**: Python script using psycopg2 to scan PostgreSQL instances
- **Schema Analysis**: SQL queries to extract metadata, constraints, and relationships
- **Data Profiling**: Statistical analysis of data distributions and quality metrics
- **Classification**: Scikit-learn model trained on data characteristics
- **Conflict Resolution**: Algorithm to merge schemas and resolve naming conflicts
- **Lineage Tracking**: Graph database to track data flow and dependencies

## Dependencies
- [ ] Access to all PostgreSQL instances
- [ ] Python environment with required libraries
- [ ] Sample data for ML model training

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 20
- Parallel: true (independent of other tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Discovery tool successfully scans all instances
- [ ] Schema analysis produces comprehensive metadata
- [ ] Data profiling identifies quality issues and patterns
- [ ] Classification model achieves 90%+ accuracy
- [ ] Conflict detection reports all schema conflicts
- [ ] Data lineage graph is complete and accurate
