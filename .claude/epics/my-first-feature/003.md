# Task: Unified Schema Design and Data Modeling

## Description
Design optimized schemas for the consolidated PostgreSQL instance and AWS Redshift data warehouse, including data modeling, relationship mapping, and performance optimization strategies.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Consolidated PostgreSQL schema designed with normalized structure
- [ ] AWS Redshift schema optimized for analytical workloads
- [ ] Data relationships mapped and foreign key constraints defined
- [ ] Indexing strategy designed for query performance
- [ ] Partitioning strategy defined for time-series data
- [ ] Data type mappings documented for transformation

## Technical Details
- **PostgreSQL Schema**: Normalized design with proper relationships and constraints
- **Redshift Schema**: Denormalized design optimized for analytical queries
- **Data Modeling**: ERD diagrams and schema documentation
- **Performance Optimization**: Index design, partitioning, and distribution keys
- **Data Types**: Mapping between source and target data types
- **Constraints**: Referential integrity and business rule enforcement

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 002: Data Discovery and Schema Analysis Tools
- [ ] Data science team requirements for analytical schema
- [ ] Business requirements for data relationships

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 12
- Parallel: false (depends on schema analysis)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] PostgreSQL schema design completed and documented
- [ ] Redshift schema design completed and documented
- [ ] Data relationships mapped and validated
- [ ] Performance optimization strategy defined
- [ ] Schema migration scripts prepared
- [ ] Data modeling documentation completed
