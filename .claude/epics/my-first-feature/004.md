# Task: ETL Pipeline Development and Orchestration

## Description
Develop comprehensive ETL pipelines using Apache Airflow for data extraction, transformation, and loading, including orchestration, error handling, and progress tracking.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Apache Airflow DAGs created for data extraction from PostgreSQL
- [ ] Data transformation pipelines developed for schema mapping
- [ ] Loading pipelines created for PostgreSQL and Redshift targets
- [ ] Error handling and retry mechanisms implemented
- [ ] Progress tracking and logging configured
- [ ] Pipeline testing framework established

## Technical Details
- **Airflow Setup**: DAGs for extraction, transformation, and loading workflows
- **Extraction**: High-performance data extractors with incremental loading
- **Transformation**: Schema mapping, data cleansing, and format conversion
- **Loading**: Parallel data loading with batch processing and error handling
- **Monitoring**: Airflow UI configuration and custom metrics
- **Testing**: Unit tests for individual components and integration tests

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: Infrastructure Setup and AWS Configuration
- [ ] Task 003: Unified Schema Design and Data Modeling
- [ ] Apache Airflow environment setup
- [ ] Sample data for testing

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XL
- Hours: 24
- Parallel: false (depends on infrastructure and schema)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All ETL pipelines developed and tested
- [ ] Error handling and retry logic implemented
- [ ] Progress tracking and monitoring operational
- [ ] Pipeline tests passing with sample data
- [ ] Documentation completed for all pipelines
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established
