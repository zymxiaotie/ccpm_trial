# Task: Broker Data Migration to AWS Redshift

## Description
Migrate broker source data to AWS Redshift with optimized schemas, partitioning, and indexing for analytical workloads, including data science workflow updates.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Broker data successfully migrated to AWS Redshift
- [ ] Redshift schemas optimized for analytical queries
- [ ] Data partitioning implemented for time-series data
- [ ] Indexes and distribution keys optimized for performance
- [ ] Data science workflows updated to use Redshift
- [ ] Query performance validated and optimized

## Technical Details
- **Redshift Migration**: ETL pipelines for broker data transformation
- **Schema Optimization**: Denormalized design for analytical workloads
- **Partitioning**: Time-based partitioning for market data
- **Performance Tuning**: Distribution keys, sort keys, and compression
- **Data Science Integration**: Update ML pipelines to use Redshift
- **Query Optimization**: Analyze and optimize common analytical queries

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 004: ETL Pipeline Development and Orchestration
- [ ] Data science team for workflow updates
- [ ] AWS Redshift cluster provisioned

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 16
- Parallel: true (can run alongside application data migration)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All broker data migrated to Redshift
- [ ] Redshift schemas optimized and documented
- [ ] Data partitioning operational
- [ ] Query performance meets requirements
- [ ] Data science workflows updated
- [ ] Redshift optimization documentation completed
