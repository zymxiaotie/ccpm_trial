# Task: Infrastructure Setup and AWS Configuration

## Description
Set up the foundational infrastructure required for the data migration system, including AWS Redshift cluster provisioning, S3 bucket configuration, monitoring stack deployment, and network security setup.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Network security groups and IAM roles configured for data access
- [ ] Backup and disaster recovery procedures tested and documented
- [ ] Cost monitoring and alerting configured for AWS resources

## Technical Details
- **Redshift Cluster**: Start with 2-node dc2.large cluster, auto-scaling enabled
- **S3 Buckets**: Create separate buckets for staging, archive, and backup data
- **Monitoring**: Deploy Prometheus on EC2, Grafana for dashboards
- **Security**: Configure VPC, security groups, and IAM policies for least privilege access
- **Backup**: Set up automated RDS snapshots and S3 cross-region replication

## Dependencies

- [ ] DevOps team for infrastructure provisioning
- [ ] Network team for security group configuration

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 16
- Parallel: true (can run alongside other infrastructure tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All AWS resources provisioned and accessible
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards operational
- [ ] Security configurations validated
- [ ] Backup procedures tested
- [ ] Infrastructure documentation completed
- [ ] Cost monitoring alerts configured
