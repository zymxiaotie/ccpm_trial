# Epic: my-first-feature

## Overview

This epic implements a comprehensive data migration system for consolidating multiple PostgreSQL instances into a unified architecture. The system will migrate application data to a single PostgreSQL instance, broker data to AWS Redshift for analytics, and intelligently archive unknown/unused data to S3. The implementation focuses on zero-downtime migration, data integrity validation, and automated monitoring to ensure successful consolidation while minimizing business disruption.

## Architecture Decisions

### Data Architecture
- **Consolidated PostgreSQL**: Single instance with optimized schema design for application data
- **AWS Redshift**: Columnar data warehouse for broker/market data analytics
- **S3 Archival**: Intelligent tiering for unknown/unused data with metadata cataloging
- **Hybrid Approach**: Maintain PostgreSQL for transactional workloads, Redshift for analytical workloads

### Technology Stack
- **ETL Framework**: Apache Airflow for orchestration and workflow management
- **Data Validation**: Custom Python scripts with Great Expectations for data quality
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana for real-time migration tracking
- **Data Classification**: ML-based approach using scikit-learn for data categorization
- **Backup Strategy**: AWS RDS snapshots + S3 cross-region replication

### Design Patterns
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Zero-downtime migration with instant rollback capability
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Asynchronous processing for large data transfers
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Automatic failure detection and recovery mechanisms
- **Data Lineage Tracking**: Comprehensive audit trail for compliance and debugging

## Technical Approach

### Data Discovery & Analysis Components
- **Schema Scanner**: Automated PostgreSQL instance discovery and schema analysis
- **Data Profiler**: Statistical analysis of data patterns, quality, and relationships
- **Classification Engine**: ML model to categorize data as application/broker/unknown
- **Conflict Resolver**: Intelligent handling of schema conflicts and data duplicates

### Migration Pipeline Components
- **Extraction Layer**: High-performance data extractors with incremental loading
- **Transformation Engine**: Schema mapping, data cleansing, and format conversion
- **Loading Orchestrator**: Parallel data loading with progress tracking and error handling
- **Validation Framework**: Multi-level data integrity checks and quality gates

### Infrastructure Components
- **Migration Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring of migration progress and health
- **Alerting System**: Proactive notifications for failures, performance issues, and data quality
- **Rollback Manager**: Automated rollback procedures with data consistency validation
- **Archive Manager**: Intelligent data archiving with compression and encryption

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Phases
1. **Foundation Phase**: Core infrastructure and monitoring setup
2. **Discovery Phase**: Data analysis and classification tools
3. **Migration Phase**: ETL pipeline development and testing
4. **Execution Phase**: Production migration with validation
5. **Optimization Phase**: Performance tuning and cleanup

### Risk Mitigation
- **Incremental Migration**: Phased approach to minimize business impact
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Staging environment mirroring production data
- **Automated Validation**: Multi-level data integrity checks at each step
- **Rollback Procedures**: Tested recovery mechanisms for each migration phase

### Testing Approach
- **Unit Testing**: Individual component validation
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end pipeline testing
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing with production-scale data
- **Disaster Recovery Testing**: Rollback and recovery procedure validation
