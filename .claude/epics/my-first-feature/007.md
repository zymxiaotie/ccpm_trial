# Task: Intelligent Data Archiving System

## Description
Implement ML-based data classification system to identify unknown/unused data and automatically archive it to S3 with compression, encryption, and metadata cataloging.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] ML-based data classification system developed and trained
- [ ] Automated archiving pipeline created for S3 storage
- [ ] Data compression and encryption implemented
- [ ] Metadata cataloging system operational
- [ ] Data retention policies configured and enforced
- [ ] Archive restoration procedures tested and documented

## Technical Details
- **ML Classification**: Scikit-learn model for data categorization
- **Archiving Pipeline**: Automated S3 upload with compression and encryption
- **Metadata Management**: Searchable catalog with data lineage information
- **Retention Policies**: Automated lifecycle management for archived data
- **Restoration**: On-demand data retrieval from S3 archives
- **Monitoring**: Tracking of archived data access and usage patterns

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 002: Data Discovery and Schema Analysis Tools
- [ ] S3 buckets configured for archiving
- [ ] ML model training data prepared

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 18
- Parallel: true (independent of migration tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] ML classification system operational
- [ ] Automated archiving pipeline functional
- [ ] Data compression and encryption working
- [ ] Metadata catalog searchable and accurate
- [ ] Retention policies enforced
- [ ] Archive restoration procedures tested
