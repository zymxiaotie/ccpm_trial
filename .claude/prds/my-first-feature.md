# PRD: my-first-feature

## Executive Summary

This PRD defines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive data migration system for our fintech stock prediction platform. The system will consolidate multiple PostgreSQL instances containing application data into a single unified instance, migrate broker source data to AWS Redshift for analytics, and intelligently archive unknown/unused data to S3 buckets. This migration will improve data accessibility, reduce infrastructure costs, and enable better analytics capabilities for stock price prediction models.

## Problem Statement

Currently, our fintech platform suffers from data fragmentation across multiple PostgreSQL instances, creating several critical issues:

**Data Fragmentation**
- Multiple PostgreSQL instances holding scattered application data
- Broker source data distributed across various databases
- No unified view of application data for analysis
- Difficult to maintain data consistency and integrity

**Operational Challenges**
- High infrastructure costs from multiple database instances
- Complex data access patterns requiring multiple connections
- Difficult to perform cross-database analytics and reporting
- Maintenance overhead from managing multiple database systems

**Analytics Limitations**
- Broker source data not optimized for analytical workloads
- No centralized data warehouse for machine learning models
- Limited ability to correlate application data with market data
- Inefficient queries across distributed data sources

**Data Governance Issues**
- Unknown data value and usage patterns
- No systematic approach to data lifecycle management
- Risk of losing potentially valuable data
- Lack of data archiving strategy for compliance and cost optimization

This migration system is essential for scaling our stock prediction capabilities, reducing operational costs, and enabling advanced analytics on unified datasets.
